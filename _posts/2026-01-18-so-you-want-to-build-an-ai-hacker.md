Everyone wants to build the next Ultron, so, why shouldn't you? Exercise your right to participate in the arms race to wipeout human creativity and craftsmanship with as cheap as a 30 USD investment and a few ounces of your sanity. 

This is a documentation of my experience building autonomous hacking systems. We'll start with harness design, learn what worked, what didn't and finally, the output.

By the end of this post you should have enough clarity to get that VC funding or at least score 90% on X-Bench and self-declare yourself the goat.
## Inside your AI hacker are two wolves
There's a phase by phase linear flow system and then there's a REPL, loop driven system.

## Phased Design 

## Feedback Loop

## But API too costly gang 
Yes, if you use OpenAI or, Anthropic Keys you will be spending 600 USD by 14th of the month. But where there's poverty and curiosity, there's three special words:

China numba wun

Unlike the mainstream providers, Chinese open-weight models are cheaper and actually quite performant. They are definitely punching above the weight that they charge for. Models like Kimi and GLM are raising the bar with every release and let lightweight pockets like mine experiment without losing rent.

For this system, I had used Z.ai's GLM 4.7. Chef's kiss model at dirt cheap price.

## Writing the first agent

## Skill issues

## Recon

## Pentest

## Correlation is causation of better vulns


## Mostly automating authenticated scanning 

## Sweet but wher UI



## Memory management

Up until a few years ago, memory management to me meant dealing with `malloc` and hunting User-After-Frees. Now, it's making sure your agents don't get premature dementia.

## Context rot and feedback loops

## You're absolutely right


## Fruits of 16 hours of code and $30
